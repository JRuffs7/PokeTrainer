Step 1: Get python environment
 - Install python 3.11.6 to your machine
 - Make sure the PATH is set so you can access it from any directory
 - Restart VSCode to be able to use it as an interpreter
    - Open a .py file and check bottom right to make sure it installed correctly
    - Open a terminal in VSCode and type 'python'. Hit enter and it should tell you version info and such
    - Ctrl+Z and enter to quit the python terminal
 - You may need to restart PC to get it fully working, that's just how python and variables are

Step 2: Get pip packages
 - In order ot run and do development you need to install three python packages
 - Open a terminal in VSCode and run the following
   - pip install flask
   - pip install discord
   - pip install python-dotenv
   - pip install pymongo
   - pip install table2ascii
 - Once they are successful, everything should be set

Step 3: Running the bot
 - The .env file should have all tokens needed to hook up to the test bot
 - Production variables are not available and will only be held on the device running the pod bot
 - To run and start testing within discord, open a terminal in VSCode and run the following
   - python main.py
 - There will be some logs and eventually one that says "PokeTrainer up and running"

 NOTES:
   - If someone is already running the bot locally, you may receive an error
     - To avoid this, make sure you communicate within the testing server
