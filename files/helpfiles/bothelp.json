  "__**SUMMARY**__\n\nPokeTrainer is a discord bot that is meant to be a fun and competitive Pokemon collecting experience. Server admins may enable this bot across different channels within a server, and every so often a Pokemon will spawn for any user to capture (within the right requirements). Trainers may collect and fight Pokemon, trade with other trainers, and even participate in events for gym badges and legendary Pokemon. There are a variety of commands and interactions for trainers to enjoy, which will be listed in further detail in the lower sections. To begin your journey, use the **/starter** command and claim your first Pokemon! Thank you for using PokeTrainer!",
  "__**SPAWNING**__\n\nEvery so often a Pokemon will spawn in a possibly random channel within the server. There will be four reactions for a trainer to interact with when a Pokemon spawns:\nüî¥ üîµ üü° ‚öîÔ∏è\nEach of these correspond to, respectively, a Pokeball, Great ball, Ultra ball, and Fight. If the trainer reacts with a *Ball*, they attempt to catch the Pokemon, while fight means they will attempt to...well, fight it! Every Pokemon has a certain spawn, detail, and ‚ú®shiny‚ú® rate, which can be further explained using **/help spawns** command.\n\n__Capture__\nTrainers own an inventory of different Pokeballs and must use them to capture the spawned Pokemon by reacting with the presented emojis. **Only one** user may catch a spawned Pokemon. The chosen ball for the attempt will give the trainer a varied chance to catch the Pokemon, the odds of capture increasing with ball strength. There are two types of failed attempts that will remove the users reaction: Reacting with a ball you do not possess, or using a valid ball but failing the capture attempt.\n\nNo Pokemon is safe! Any trainer may react to any Pokemon, but keep in mind your inventory counts! More information can be found using the **/help capture** command.\n\n__Fighting__\nTrainers have a set HP assigned to them, maxing at 100. Reacting with *Fight* will use some HP, but give the user a chance to win money and have their Pokemon gain experience. All users may fight the spawned Pokemon just once, as long as they have at least 1 HP. You may refill your HP by buying and using Potions from the store. For more details on fights, use the **/help fight** command.",
  "__**TRAINERS**__\n\nTrainers in PokeTrainer have a number of different attributes that can be viewed and modified. In greater detail below, trainers can interact with their: inventory, Pokedex, battle team, badges, and statistics. Each trainer is unique per server, so all data seen in one server is most likely completely different than another!\n\n__Inventory__\nEach trainer will have an inventory of items at their disposal when interacting with PokeTrainer. As of now, there are only two types of items: Pokeballs and Potions. Both of these items can be bought through the shop using the **/buy** command.\n\nPokeballs are used when capturing wild Pokemon, and there are three different types: Pokeball, Greatball, and Ultraball. Each ball gives the trainer a different chance of capturing the Pokemon which can be seen using the **/help capture** command.\n\nPotions are used to replenish a trainers HP after battling wild Pokemon. Potions will only be used when the trainer is missing HP, and there are three types: Potion (10HP), Super Potion (40HP), Hyper Potion (80HP), and Max Potion (100HP).",
