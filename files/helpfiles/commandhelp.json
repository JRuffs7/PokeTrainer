Here is a list of Pokemon types that do not spawn:\n- Mega forms\n- Ultra Beasts\n- Paradox\n- Fossils\n- Legendaries/Mythicals\n- Starters.\n\n__Details__\nSome details that are calculated during the spawn process are *shiny rate*, *height/weight*, and *female chance*\n- **Shiny Rate** - Currently set at 1/3000\n- **Height/Weight** - +/- 10% of the average stat seen from **/pokeinfo**\n- **Gender** - Each Pokemon has a stat out of 8 to be female.\nIcons on a spawn will be as such:\n- ✅: You have this Pokedex entry already registered\n- ☑️: You have this specific form already registered\n- 🟦/🟥: The gender of the current spawn\n- ✨: If the current spawn is a shiny\n\nEvery spawn will have 4 buttons attached: Pokeball, Greatball, Ultraball, and Fight. The Pokeballs are used for capturing, while the fight button is used for....fighting! An explanation for each can be seen through **/help capture** and **/help fight**.",

There will be a fight (⚔️) reaction to initiate the fight with your current team. If you lose the fight, there is no penalty but you will not be able to challenge the trainer again.\n\nSimilar to the other fights, rarity, type matchup, and level are all used to determine which Pokemon wins each match. However, in these fights it goes both ways. This means each Pokemon will take a \"turn\" fighting and based on who has the more favorable outcome, a victor will be shown. There is not **/battlesim** for these fights, but you can get a vague idea by simulating a wild fight. Levels for the opponents Pokemon will be given during events.\n\nNOTE: If the event fights work out as planned, this fighting style will be used for trainer vs trainer battles in the future!\n\n**__Wild Fight__**\nWhen a Pokemon spawns, there is a reaction available to fight it (⚔️). This will provide money ($25) and experience to the Pokemon you choose to fight. You must have some amount of HP to expend for a fight to occur, the command will warn you if your HP is low.\n\nFighting results are based off of 3 different comparisons: typing matchup, level, and rarity. When a trainer fights a wild Pokemon, they are always on the offensive. This means every typing check is based off of the trainer's Pokemon being the attacker and the wild Pokemon being the defender.\n\nLosing 10hp or more will consider the battle lost and will reward no experience or money.\n\nNOTE: Pokemon levels can reduce/increase the amount of health lost depending on the scale.\n\n**__Gym Battle__**\nWhen you trigger a gym battle by using **/gymbattle**, the fight is slightly different compared to a wild fight. It does not cost HP to fight a gym leader, but money instead. More can be seen through **/help gymbattle**.\n\nThe fight results are based off of similar comparisons: typing matchup and rarity, with level being a last resort factor in most cases. Gym Leader Levels are as such:\n- First Stage: **Level 15**\n- Second Stage/No Evolution: **Level 25**\n- Final Stage: **Level 35**\n- Voltage Gym: **Level 100**\nThe gym battle will start from the first slot of each team, eliminating one Pokemon per round until a team is wiped out.\n\n\nFor a deeper dive on fights, you can use **/battlesim** to mock a wild or gym battle.",

Two normal examples are the Pidgey/Fearow lines:\n```Pidgey (1) ---> Pidgeotto (3) ---> Pidgeot (5)\n\nSpearow (2) ---> Fearow (4)```\nOne strange example is the Mime Jr. line:\n```             ---> Mr. Mime (4)\nMime Jr. (1) |\n             ---> Galarian Mr. Mime (3) ---> Mr. Rime (5)```\nMime Jr. is considered a rarity 1 because it's the initial stage and its maximum chain is 3 evolutions. Mr. Mime is considered rarity 4 because it's considered the final evolution in a 2-stage chain.\n\nDuring battles, Pokemon are placed into something called __rarity groups__.
