Details can be seen using **/help rarity**.\n\nLosing 10hp or more will consider the battle lost and will reward no exp or money.\n\nNOTE: Pokemon level advantage can reduce the amount of health lost depending on the scale of discrepency (currently 1.5x and 2x are the benchmarks).\n\n**__Gym Battle__**\nWhen you trigger a gym battle by using **/gymbattle**, the fight uses similar mechanics to a wild fight. It does not cost HP to fight a gym leader, but money instead. More can be seen through **/help gymbattle**.\nThe fight results are based off of similar comparisons: typing matchup and rarity. The gym battle will start from the first slot of each team, eliminating one Pokemon per round until a team is wiped out.\nFor a trainer Pokemon to defeat a gym Pokemon these three conditions must be met:\n- They must have a super advantage (through one or both types)\n- Trainer Pokemon must have the same rarity group or higher than the opponents rarity group\nBattle example seen below, explanation afterward:```ansi\n\n| \u001b[0;31mGardevoir\u001b[0m | \u001b[0;37mStaryu\u001b[0m  |\n|  \u001b[0;37mLeafeon\u001b[0m  | \u001b[0;31mStaryu\u001b[0m  |  \n|  \u001b[0;31mLeafeon\u001b[0m  | \u001b[0;37mStarmie\u001b[0m |\n|  \u001b[0;31mNuzleaf\u001b[0m  | \u001b[0;37mStarmie\u001b[0m |```\n1. Gardevoir lost to Staryu because although it has a higher rarity group (3 vs 1), it did not have double advantage with typing (Psychic/Fairy vs Water)\n2. Leafeon defeated Staryu because it has a higher rarity group (3 vs 1), it has super advantage (Grass vs Water)\n3. Leafeon lost to Starmie because although it has equal rarity group (3 vs 3), it only has one advantage (Grass vs Water NOT Grass vs Psychic)\n4. Nuzleaf lost to Starmie because it has a lower rarity group (2 vs 3)",

Some examples are *Grass* types, *shiny*, or even *legendary*. By entering, your Pokedex will be searched for the criteria and will enter with the count of Pokemon you own that belong to the category. The winner of this event will receive 1x Masterball, second place will receive 5x Ultraballs, and third place will receive 10x Greatballs.\n\n**__Stat Comparison__**\nThis will give a specific statistic that will select a single Pokemon from your Dex. For example: the category could be the heaviest Pokemon you own. When entering, the heaviest Pokemon you own will be selected for your entry. The winner of this event will receive 1x Masterball, second place will receive 5x Ultraballs, and third place will receive 10x Greatballs.\n\n**__Special Spawns__**\nThis is where you can get Pokemon not obtainable through the means of **/spawn**. Categories include: starters, fossil Pokemon, Ultra Beasts, Paradox, and Legendary/Mythical Pokemon. Whichever category spawns during this event can only be caught with a __Masterball__.",
