When fighting a wild Pokemon, the Pokemon in the first slow of the trainers team will be used to fight. Trainers can change their team using the **/modifyteam** command. Calculations and examples of fights seen below.\n\nThe first and second comparisons on *typing* are treated the exact same way. When a trainer fights a wild Pokemon, they are always on the offensive. This means every typing check is based off of the trainer's Pokemon being the attacker and the wild Pokemon being the defender. Each type can be strong, weak, neutral, or inaffective against the defending type. If a Pokemon only has one type, it will use that same type for the first and second comparison. Examples:\n```Chinchou (Water/Electric) vs Charizard (Fire/Flying)\n- Water vs Fire      --> Chinchou Wins\n- Electric vs Flying --> Chinchou Wins\nNinetales (Fire) vs Dewgong (Water/Ice)\n- Fire vs Water      --> Dewgong Wins\n- Fire vs Ice        --> Ninetales Wins```\nNow based on just this, Chinchou would beat a Charizard....but that doesn't make much sense, so then Rarity of each may also come into play.\n\nRarity has a large part in the battle, but only if it actually bcomes a determining factor. If rarity is decided, the larger the difference beween the two, the bigger the impact.\n```First-stage vs Final-stage:\nRarity will superceed type advantages.\n- Chinchou (2) vs Charizard (5) --> Charizard Wins\n- Ralts (1) vs Machamp (5)      --> Machamp Wins\n\nFirst-stage vs Middle-stage (or non-evolving):\nMiddle-stage (or non-evolving) vs Final-stage:\nRarity will only come into play if the lower-rarity Pokemon does NOT have a double type advantage.\n- Squirtle (1) vs. Charmeleon (3) --> No rarity impact\n- Gloom (3) vs Gyarados (4) --> Rarity will be a factor```\nWhen fighting wild Pokemon, the amount of trainer HP lost is determined by how many above comparisons the trainer's Pokemon wins or loses.
