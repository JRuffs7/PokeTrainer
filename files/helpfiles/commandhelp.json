      "HelpString": "Rarity is best described as how rare a Pokemon is to be chosen during a **/spawn** command. There are 5 different levels of rarity (not including legendaries):\n```Level 1 - Stage 1 of a 3-stage evolution.\n- Examples: Pidgey, Nidoran.\nLevel 2 - Stage 1 of a 2-stage evolution.\n- Examples: Onix, Eevee.\nLevel 3 - Stage 2 of a 3-stage evolution OR a Pokemon without an evolution.\n- Examples: Lapras, Haunter.\nLevel 4 - Final stage of a 2-stage evolution.\n- Examples: Gyarados, Weezing.\nLevel 5 - Final stage of a 3-stage evolution.\n- Examples: Victreebel, Dragonite.```\nRarity is calculated based on if there are evolutions preceeding or succeeding the current Pokemon, and how many. Two normal examples are the Pidgey/Fearow lines:\n```Pidgey (1) ---> Pidgeotto (3) ---> Pidgeot (5)\n\nSpearow (2) ---> Fearow (4)```\nOne strange example is the Mime Jr. line:\n```             ---> Mr. Mime (4)\nMime Jr. (1) |\n             ---> Galarian Mr. Mime (3) ---> Mr. Rime (5)```\nMime Jr. is considered a rarity 1 because it's the initial stage and its maximum chain is 3 evolutions. Mr. Mime is considered rarity 4 because it's considered the final evolution in a 2-stage chain.\n\nDuring battles, Pokemon are placed into something called __rarity groups__. These are based on the initial rarity of the Pokemon:\n```Rarity Group 1: Stage 1 Pokemon (Rarity 1/2)\n- Examples: Pidgey, Spearow\n\nRarity Group 2: Middle or No Evolution Pokemon (Rarity 3)\n- Examples: Pidgeotto, Lapras\n\nRarity Group 3: Final Stage Pokemon (Rarity 4/5)\n- Examples: Pidgeot, Fearow\n\nLegendaries have their own grouping based on their high rarities (8/9/10)```",

      "ShortString": "",
      "HelpString": "There are two types of fights that a trainer can partake in: wild fights and gym battles.\n\n**__Wild Fight__**\nWhen a Pokemon spawns, there is a reaction available to fight it (⚔️). This will provide money and experience to the Pokemon you choose to fight. You must have some amount of HP to expend for a fight to occur, the command will warn you if your HP is low.\nFighting results are based off of 3 different comparisons: typing matchup, level, and rarity.\n\nWhen a trainer fights a wild Pokemon, they are always on the offensive. This means every typing check is based off of the trainer's Pokemon being the attacker and the wild Pokemon being the defender. Types can be strong, weak, neutral, or inaffective. Examples:\n```Water vs Fire      --> Attacker Wins\nElectric vs Flying --> Attacker Wins\nFire vs Water      --> Defender Wins\nFire vs Ghost      --> Push```\nNow based on just this, a Chinchou would beat a Charizard....but that doesn't make sense, so then Rarity comes into play.\n\nRarity plays a large part in battle, being the base factor for how much HP is lost for the fight. Details can be seen using **/help rarity**.\n\nLosing 10hp or more will consider the battle lost and will reward no exp or money.\n\nNOTE: Pokemon level advantage can reduce the amount of health lost depending on the scale of discrepancy (currently 1.5x and 2x are the benchmarks).\n\n**__Gym Battle__**\nWhen you trigger a gym battle by using **/gymbattle**, the fight is slightly different compared to a wild fight. It does not cost HP to fight a gym leader, but money instead. More can be seen through **/help gymbattle**.\nThe fight results are based off of similar comparisons: typing matchup and rarity, with level being a very low factor without high discrepancy. Gym Leader Levels are as such:\n- First Stage: **Level 15**\n- Second Stage/No Evolution: **Level 25**\n- Final Stage: **Level 35**\n- Voltage Gym: **Level 100**\nThe gym battle will start from the first slot of each team, eliminating one Pokemon per round until a team is wiped out. For a trainer Pokemon to defeat a gym Pokemon these are the different scenarios:\n\n**Super Advantage**\nTo meet the criteria for super advantage, the trainer Pokemon must fall into one of the following categories:\n- They must have two advantages (through one or both types) with no resistances from the gym Pokemon\n```Wooper vs Onix      --> SUCCESS\nAlakazam vs Geodude --> FAIL```\n- They must have one advantage (possibly two advantages with one resistance), but must be the same rarity group or higher with a level advantage over x1.5.\n```Charizard(Lvl.53) vs Ludicolo(Lvl.35) --> SUCCESS\nKricketune(Lvl.30) vs Doliv(Lvl.25)   --> FAIL```\nIf a Gym Leader has a Special Pokemon(Legendary/Mythical/Beast/etc.), the rules change a bit:\n- Trainer Pokemon MUST also be a Special Pokemon\n- Trainer Pokemon must ALWAYS have a double advantage with typing only\n- Double advantage is changed to single advantage with no resistance when attacking with a mono-type Special Pokemon\nMore examples below with explanations afterward:```Gardevoir(Lvl.50) vs Staryu(Lvl15)   --> FAIL\nNuzleaf(Lvl.53) vs Golem(Lvl.35)     --> SUCCESS\nLeafeon(Lvl.40) vs Poliwrath(Lvl.35) --> FAIL\nMachamp(Lvl.100) vs Darkrai(Lvl.100) --> FAIL```\n1. Gardevoir lost to Staryu because although it has a higher rarity group and level, it did not have any advantage with typing\n2. Nuzleaf defeated Golem because it has a double type advantage with no resistance, and has a 1.5x level advantage.\n3. Leafeon lost to Poliwrath because it only has one advantage and did not have 1.5x level advantage.\n4. Machamp lost to Darkrai because it is not a Legendary/Mythical.",
